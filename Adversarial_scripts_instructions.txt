The relevant script to run is gen_adversarial.py 

This script loads config_adv.yml which loads the model and the attack.
Currently the dataset name is set to 'existing' which just load saved
images instead of creating them anew. There are some inefficiencies here
(in config_adv.yml) in that one needs to adjust :

the model name needs to be set,
the model id and filepath must correspond to that model.

The other thing is that within gen_adversarial there are
for loops which just takes a chunk of the datased and 
tries to apply the attack on it. So far its just spaghetti
code but the aim is to get 1 example running (which it
currently fails to do for FGSM)

you might need to clone foolbox locally and dont forget to
downgrade TF version to 2.1.0.
